# Minimizing-Delays-in-Task-Execution-Tools-via-TFSM-Synchronizing-and-Homing-Sequences
To reproduce the experimental evaluation from the paper (i.e., to compute the average execution delay), add for_delay_evaluation/main.py to the CMT-VSE project (https://github.com/vinevg1996/CMT-VSE). The TFSM model for the application scenario is provided in for_delay_evaluation/tfsm_ansible_host.tfsm.

The Ansible playbooks used to evaluate execution delays are located in the playbook_for_delay_evaluation/ directory.
